# Hemlock

Hemlock is a systems programming language that emphasizes reliable high performance parallel
computation. Hemlock synthesizes the expressive type and module systems of [ML-family
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)), a unified parametric
effects/mutability/type system, and the shared-nothing message-passing parallelism of
[Erlang](https://erlang.org/).

## Getting Started

Hemlock is a work in progress, and is not yet self hosting (i.e. it is written in OCaml rather than
Hemlock). As such, Hemlock may interest researchers and programming language developers, but it is
not yet suited for any sort of production use.

### Prerequisites

There are two separate methods for building the bootstrap compiler (Docker and Native). Follow
prerequisites for your preferred method.

#### Docker Prerequisites

Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Install [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/).

Build the Hemlock `prod` docker image from the root of the Hemlock repo checkout.

```sh
docker compose build prod
```

Run a Hemlock `prod` docker container.

```sh
docker compose run prod
```

(Optional) Install
[binfmt_misc](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/#build-multi-platform-images). This
enables building and running cross-platform images.
```sh
docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
HEMLOCK_PLATFORM=linux/arm64 docker compose build prod
HEMLOCK_PLATFORM=linux/arm64 docker compose run prod
```

##### (Optional) Building Dotfiles Into `dev` Image

Set a `DOTFILES_URL` environment variable to include your dotfiles in the Hemlock `dev` image.

```sh
export DOTFILES_URL=https://github.com/<you>/dotfiles.git
docker compose build dev
docker compose run dev
```

Note that cloning dotfiles via SSH is not supported due to current `docker compose` limitations.

You may include an `install.sh` script at the base of your dotfiles repo to automatically execute
dotfiles setup during `docker compose build dev`.

Set an additional environment variable, `DOTFILES_HASH` if you need `docker compose build dev` to
rebuild dotfiles whenever the hash changes. This is useful when making upstream changes in your
dotfiles repo. You may find it best to set `DOTFILES_*` variables programmatically via your shell
setup script like so.

```sh
pushd $YOUR_DOTFILES_PATH > /dev/null
export DOTFILES_URL=$(git remote get-url origin 2> /dev/null || :)
export DOTFILES_HASH=$(git rev-parse origin/main 2> /dev/null || :)
popd > /dev/null
```

#### Native Prerequisites

The bootstrap compiler depends on [OCaml](http://ocaml.org/) and the [Dune](https://dune.build/)
build system, as well as several ppx rewriters.  [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) is the recommended
mechanism for installing and maintaining an OCaml development environment. To install the necessary
dependencies into an existing opam repository, run

```sh
cd bootstrap
opam install --deps-only .
```

### Building

To build the bootstrap `hmc` Hemlock compiler and invoke the test suite, run

```sh
cd bootstrap
dune build
dune runtest
```

See the [Dune documentation](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details on building
and interacting with `hmc` via the build system.

To build the bootstrap standard library documentation, run

```sh
dune build @doc
```

Use a web browser to open the documentation at `_build/default/_doc/_html/index.html`.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are required to pass tests before being merged to `main`. Pull request CI checks that
tests passed as part of Hemlock's custom `gh push` process. Use our custom
[gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) CLI [extension](https://github.com/BranchTaken/gh-push) to push,
test, and record the test result status of branches.
