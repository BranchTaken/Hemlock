# Syntax

Hemlock's syntax derives from [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), which in turn is
loosely based on the [lambda
calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) syntax. Hemlock omits
OCaml syntax such as that for objects and polymorphic variants, and adds syntax
for distinct features like algebraic effects. But the biggest difference is that
Hemlock uses indentation to rigidly define block structure.

## Encoding

Hemlock uses [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoding. A [byte
order mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) prefix will cause a
syntax error and should therefore always be omitted. Encoding errors result in
one or more `�` replacement codepoint substitutions. Such replacements of
invalid encoding are silently ignored inside comments, but they explicitly cause
scanning errors if inside codepoint/string literals, and elsewhere they result
in error tokens which cause parsing errors.

## Indentation

Semantically meaningful indentation has multiple advantages:

- Programmers typically indent code to indicate block structure, in order to
  streamline human understanding, even if the compiler is oblivious to
  indentation. Making indentation meaningful reduces the gap between the
  programmer's mental model and the language semantics.
- Fewer symbols are required. The omission of lines consisting only of `end` or
  `}` tends to reduce total number of lines, even as compared with a two-column
  indentation style. (Hemlock enforces four-column indentation; more on that
  below.)
- Automated code formatting tools are brain-dead simple as compared with the
  near-sentience required to implement typical coding styles in many
  contemporary languages.
- One of the most effective general heuristics for parser error recovery is to
  heed indentation and restart parsing at the enclosing indentation level. By
  mandating proper indentation, error recovery is yet more effective, and it
  becomes feasible to provide code introspection services even for source files
  in intermediate editing states.

Several other contemporary languages have semantically meaningful indentation,
but approaches vary considerably. The following languages have particularly
interesting takes on the problem.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) is the most widely used language for which
  indentation is significant, and the rules for what constitutes acceptable
  indentation are quite flexible. The details changed a bit between Python 2 and
  3 to reduce ways in which tab width could obscure code meaning.
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) requires continuation of an expressions to
  be indented more than its beginning token. The rules are simple and
  consistent; the biggest common pitfall is that if a multi-line expression
  starts on a line with preceding tokens that change length, the entire
  expression must be re-indented during refactoring.
- [F#](https://fsharp.org/) indentation is modeled as an "offside" rule similar
  to that used in soccer. Although elegant in concept, this approach motivates
  an unfortunate set of special cases which allow multi-line expressions to be
  indented "prettily", e.g. with math operators aligned.

Hemlock takes a comparatively simple approach to avoid some of the pitfalls
mentioned above:

- Tabs are forbidden in whitespace. (Tabs can be embedded only in string
  literals and comments.)
- The first non-whitespace token establishes line indentation.
- Block indentation is four columns.
- Expression continuation indentation is two colums. One-column and three-column
  indentation are *always* invalid, which eliminates undetected off-by-one
  errors.
- The raw `'\n'` at the end of a line is treated as non-breaking whitespace if
  immediately preceded by a `'\\'`. This acts as an escape hatch which allows
  arbitrary continuation indentation.
- Unindented lines comprising only comments and/or whitespace are ignored.
- Consecutive lines at the same indentation are distinct expressions.

Automated formatting only needs to perform a few actions:

- Wrap lines that exceed 80 columns if at all possible without changing the
  token stream.
- Strip extraneous trailing whitespace, including any `'\n'` codepoints
  following the last token.
- Dense wrapping of expressions (as well as removal of `'\\'` continuation) can
  be used to enforce uniform coding style. This is Hemlock's answer to endless
  coding style debate, but it is a draconian approach, and therefore opt-in. In
  the absence of dense wrapping, code formatting style guidelines are pretty
  minimal.

  + Wrap expressions such that lines do not exceed 80 columns if possible.
    (Don't bother with heroics such as string literal splitting unless it makes
    the code more readable.)
  + Prefer to densely wrap long expressions unless sparser wrapping
    significantly improves readability.
  + Use additional inter-token alignment spacing only if it significantly
    improves readability.
  + Use `'\\'` continuation sparingly.

## Tokens

### Whitespace

Whitespace comprises space (`' '`) and newline (`'\n'`) codepoints. Tabs,
carriage returns, form feeds, etc. are not treated as whitespace.

### Comment

Comments have two syntaxes.
- Single-line `#...` comments are delimited by a leading `#` and a trailing
  `\n` (or end of input).
- `(*...*)` comments are delimited by symmetric `(*` and `*)` sequences, which
  allows `(* comments (* to be *) nested *)`.

### Punctuation

Hemlock uses various symbols as punctuation:

```hemlock
. , ; : :: :=
( ) [ ] [| |] { } {| |}
\ ' ^ &
~ ?
| ~> -> >->
```

### Operator

In addition to punctuation, Hemlock supports an extensible set of operators.
Operators are either prefix or infix, as determined by the leading codepoint.

- Prefix operator: `[~?][-+*/%@!$<=>|:.~?]+`
- Infix operator: `[-+*/%@!$<=>|:.~?]+` excluding punctuation symbols

### Keyword

The following words are keywords which are used as syntactic elements, and
cannot be used for other purposes.

```hemlock
and      external  match   val
also     false     module  when
as       for       of      while
assert   fun       open    with
conceal  function  or
do       if        rec
downto   import    then
effect   include   to
else     lazy      true
expose   let       type
```

### Identifier

The first non-underscore codepoint of an identifier helps distinguish
namespaces. Identifiers which begin with `'_'` are exempt from compiler warnings
regarding unused values. `'_'` by itself is special in that it creates no
lexical binding at all.

- Capitalized identifiers match `[_]*[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9_']*`, and are used for
  module names and variant type constructors.
- Uncapitalized identifiers match `[_]*[a-z][A-Za-z0-9_']*`, and are used for
  value names, parameter label names, type names, and record field names.

### Integer

Integers are either signed or unsigned, though a leading sign is always a
separate token. Integer literals may be specified in any of four bases, as
determined by optional base prefix:

- `0b`: Binary, where digits are in `[01]`.
- `0o`: Octal, where digits are in `[0-7]`.
- Default: Decimal, where digits are in `[0-9]`.
- `0x`: Hexadecimal, where digits are in `[0-9a-f]`.

`_` codepoints may be arbitrarily placed before/after any digit as desired to
make literals easier to read.

Integers are unsigned 64-bit by default, but may be unsigned/signed and of
different bitwidth, depending on optional type suffix:

- Unsigned:
  + `u8`: Unsigned 8-bit
  + `u16`: Unsigned 16-bit
  + `u32`: Unsigned 32-bit
  + `u64`/`u`: Unsigned 64-bit (`uns` type)
  + `u128`: Unsigned 128-bit
  + `u256`: Unsigned 256-bit
  + `u512`: Unsigned 512-bit
- Signed:
  + `i8`: Signed 8-bit
  + `i16`: Signed 16-bit
  + `i32`: Signed 32-bit
  + `i64`/`i`: Signed 64-bit (`int` type)
  + `i128`: Signed 128-bit
  + `i256`: Signed 256-bit
  + `i512`: Signed 512-bit

Examples:

- `uns`
  ```hemlock
  0
  42
  15u
  17u64
  0x0123_4567_89ab_cdef
  0o660
  0b10_0001
  0b0100_0001
  1_000_000
  0x___1_fffd
  ```
- `int`
  ```hemlock
  0i
  42i
  17i64
  0x_ab__c_i
  0o777
  ```
- `byte`
  ```hemlock
  0u8
  0xffu8
  ```

### Real

Real numbers use the [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) binary
floating point format. Real number literals are distinct from integer literals
in at least one of the following ways:

- Decimal point
- Exponent
- Type suffix

Reals are signed, though a leading sign is always a separate token. Real number
literal mantissas may be specified in any of four bases, as determined by
optional base prefix:

- `0b`: Binary, where digits are in `[01]`. All well formed binary literals have
  bit-precise machine representations.
- `0o`: Octal, where digits are in `[0-7]`. All well formed octal literals have
  bit-precise machine representations.
- Default: Decimal, where digits are in `[0-9]`. Not all decimal-format literals
  have bit-precise machine representations; favor the other bases if this is of
  significance to the application.
- `0x`: Hexadecimal, where digits are in `[0-9a-f]`. All well formed hexadecimal
  literals have bit-precise machine representations.

Optional signed exponents are separated from a binary/octal/hexadecimal mantissa
by a `p` codepoint, or from a decimal mantissa by an `e` codepoint. The optional
exponent sign is in `[-+]`. The exponent is always expressed as a decimal value,
where digits are in `[0-9]`, but the implicit base of the exponent depends on
the mantissa's base prefix:

- Binary (`0b<mantissa>p<exponent>`): *mantissa*<sub>2</sub> ×
  2<sup>*exponent*<sub>10</sub></sup>
- Octal (`0o<mantissa>p<exponent>`): *mantissa<sub>8</sub>* ×
  2<sup>*exponent<sub>10</sub>*</sup>
- Decimal (`<mantissa>e<exponent>`): *mantissa<sub>10</sub>* ×
  10<sup>*exponent<sub>10</sub>*</sup>
- Hexadecimal (`0x<mantissa>p<exponent>`): *mantissa<sub>16</sub>* ×
  2<sup>*exponent<sub>10</sub>*</sup>

`_` codepoints may be arbitrarily placed before/after any mantissa digit or
exponent sign/digit as desired to make literals easier to read.

Reals are 64-bit by default, but may be of different bitwidth, depending on
optional type suffix:

- `r32`: 32-bit ["single-precision
  float"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format)
- `r64`/`r`: 64-bit ["double-precision
  float"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)
  (`real` type)

Examples:

```hemlock
0.
0e0
0r
0r64
1.0
1_000_000.0
42.e44
42.3e-78
0b1.101p42
0o7.406p42
0x4.a3
0x4a.3d2p+42
1.5r32
0x4a.3d2p+42_r32
1.234_567_e_+89_r32
```

### Codepoint

Codepoint tokens are delimited by `'` codepoints, and their contents are
interpolated for a limited set of codepoint sequences.
- `\u{...}`: Hexadecimal-encoded codepoint, e.g. `\u{fffd}` is the `�`
  replacement codepoint.
- `\t`: Tab (`\u{9}`).
- `\n`: Newline, aka line feed (`\u{a}`).
- `\r`: Return (`\u{d}`).
- `\'`: Single quote.
- `\\`: Backslash.

Examples:

```hemlock
'A'
'\u{10197}' # '𐆗'
'\t'
'\r'
'\n'
'\''
'\\'
```

Note that `'` is also used as the sigil for type parameters, e.g. in `'a t`.
Type parameter sigils and codepoint literal delimiters never cause grammar
ambiguity, but invalid source code may result in surprising syntax errors
because type parameters and codepoint literals have overlapping valid prefixes.

### String

String tokens have three distinct syntaxes, all of which are useful depending on
contents and context:

- **Interpolated** strings are delimited by `"` codepoints, and their contents
  are interpolated for a limited set of codepoint sequences.
  ```hemlock
  "Interpolated string without any interpolated sequences"
  ```
  The following codepoint sequences are interpolated as indicated:
  + `\u{...}`: Hexadecimal-encoded codepoint, e.g. `\u{fffd}` is the `�`
    replacement codepoint.
  + `\t`: Tab (`\u{9}`).
  + `\n`: Newline, aka line feed (`\u{a}`).
  + `\r`: Return (`\u{d}`).
  + `\"`: Double quote.
  + `\\`: Backslash.
  + `\␤`: Newline omitted. This allows a string literal to be broken across
    lines without the line breaks becoming part of the string.
    ```hemlock
    "Single-line \
    interpolated string"
    ```
- **Raw** strings are delimited by matching `` `([^|`][^`]*)?` `` sequences,
  where the optional tag between the `` ` `` codepoints can be used to
  distinguish the delimiters from string contents.
  ```hemlock
  ``Simple raw string``
  `_`String would ``end prematurely`` without a tag`_`
  ```
  If the raw string begins and/or ends with a `\n`, that codepoint is omitted.
  This allows raw string delimiters to be on separate lines from the string
  contents without changing the string.
  ```hemlock
  ``Single-line raw string``
  ``
  Single-line raw string
  ``
  ```

  ```hemlock
  ``

  Three-line raw string

  ``
  ```
- **Bar-margin [raw] strings** are delimited by `` `| `` and a codepoint
  sequence matching `` ^[ ]*` ``. Each line past the first one is prefixed by
  enough whitespace to align a `|` with the opening delimiter's `|`. The per
  line leading whitespace and `|` are omitted from the string; they provide a
  left margin for the string contents.
  ```hemlock
  `|First line
   |Second line
  `
  ```
  Note that the final `\n` preceding the closing delimiter is itself part of the
  delimiter and is omitted.
  ```hemlock
  `|Single-line bar-margin string
  `
  `|Two-line bar-margin string
   |
  `
  ```

## Line directives

Token path/line/column locations are ordinarily a simple function of the source
stream from which they derive, but if the source stream is generated from
another source, e.g. using a parser generator, it can be useful to associate
tokens with the pre-generated source locations. Line directives provide a
mechanism for setting the line and path for subsequent source lines. Line
directives are consumed by the scanner and no tokens result unless there is a
syntax error in the line directive. As such, the line directive syntax is
extremely rigid. Line directives begin with `:` at column 0, followed by
positive decimal line number (leading zero prohibited), followed by optional
single space and double-quoted string path, terminated by newline.

Examples:

```hemlock
:42␤
:42 "foo.hm"␤
```
