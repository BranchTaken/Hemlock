# Effects and mutability

If Hemlock were a pure functional language, it would be effectless; its output
would depend only on its initial input. Hemlock does have a pure, effectless
core, but non-trivial Hemlock programs rely on effects, which can be roughly
categorized as:

- Mutation of mutable data structures. For example, mutable arrays are sometimes
  the most efficient data structure for highly interdependent data and
  algorithms.
- Messages between actors. A Hemlock program need not run more than a single
  actor, but managing actor lifetimes, sending/receiving messages to/from other
  actors, etc. is all effectful computation.
- Input/output mediated by the host operating system, whether for durable
  storage, communication with other processes and/or computers, etc., are all
  effects outside the runtime system.
- Halting prevents subsequent computation, although an cannot observe itself
  halting. In many cases it is okay for an actor to ignore whether a computation
  may halt, but calls to functions like `assert` must not be optimized out, even
  though the calls produce no outputs.

Runtime system effects can be thought of in terms of reading/writing mutable
program state. Reading a mutable value may not seem like it should be
considered an effect, but the fact that the mutable value does not have a stable
state means that repeated reads of the same value may return differing results,
thus affecting subsequent computation. Effectful reads must happen at "the right
time" to preserve program correctness, whereas reads of immutable values may
occur at any time prior to use. Halting is not effectful from the halting
actor's perspective, but other actors can observe the effect.

Operating system effects are similar to runtime system effects in that repeating
an effectful operation may produce differing results. However, Hemlock cannot
model operating system state transitions with as much detail as for runtime
system effects, so no practical distinction can be made between operating system
read versus write effects.

## Syntax quick reference

For more semantics detail than is provided in the following syntax quick
reference, see below.

- Effects
  - `>{>e,>f}`, `>e`, `>`: Parametric effect(s). The `>e` and `>` short forms
    can be used only if there is only one parametric effect.
  - `>_`: Effects are contextually irrelevant, and therefore arbitrarily
    permitted.
  - Select pre-defined effects.
    + `>{os}`: Operating system read-write effect
    + `>{ld}`: Runtime system read effect
    + `>{mut}`: Runtime system read-write effect
    + `>{hlt}`: Runtime system may-halt effect
  - `>{os,hlt}`: Set of effects.
  - `>{>e,>f}\{os,mut}`, `>\{mut}`: Effects constraint; transitively prohibited
    effects are enumerated as `\{...}` following any effects.
  - `('a t& >{mut}~> -> unit)`, `('a t& >{mut}~> >{hlt}-> unit)`: Mutation
    effect on function parameter, separated from effects on lexical closure by
    the `~>` delimiter. Function-parameter-specific effects can be paramatric
    and/or constrained, though this is less common than for lexical closure
    effects.
- Mutability
  - `^m t`, `^m t ^t`, `^m t^`: Parametric mutability. `^m` is an indirect
    mutability parameter, whereas `^t` comes after the type name and is the
    direct mutability parameter. When otherwise unambiguous in a type
    expression, `t ^t` can be shortened to `t^` (or `t ^`) and the parameter
    takes the same name as the type.
  - `^_ t`, `^_ t^_`: Mutability is contextually irrelevant, and therefore both
    immutable and mutable values are supported.
  - `t&`: Non-parametric direct mutability. `>{mut}~>` indicates an effect on the
    value, which must therefore be mutable, as in `'a t& >{mut}~>`.
  - `t\&`, `^_ t^_\&`: Transitive prohibited mutability constraint.
- Parametric types:
  - `'a`: Parametric type, whether simple as in `uns` or with its own parameters
    as in `('aa, ^m, >e) 'a^`.
  - `'a t`, `('a, ^m, >e) t`, ...: Directly immutable parametric type.
  - `'a t&`, `('a, ^m, >e) t&`, ...: Directly mutable parametric type.
  - `'a t ^t`, `'a t^`, `('a, ^m) t^`: Parametric type with parametric direct
    mutability. `^m` is an indirect mutability parameter, whereas the direct
    mutability parameter `^t` is distinct from the comma-separated `(...)`
    parameter list, such that its absence and the absence of `&` indicates that
    the type is directly immutable.
  - `val f: 'a -> 'a t^`: The function produces an isolated value with
    parametric mutability. The value's mutability is either immutable or mutable
    as determined by type unification in the caller's context.
  - `('a, ^m, >e) ['c, 'd] t&`: Directly mutable type with transitive effects
    and mutability determined by `('a, ^m, >e)`, and additional parameters which
    have no impact on the type's transitive effects and mutability determined by
    `['c, 'd]`.
  - `('a, >t\{rt}) t\&`: Parametric type constrained to prohibit both runtime
    system effects and transitive mutability.

# Static inference

Hemlock statically determines all effects and mutability transitively associated
with a type, whether direct or indirect. Runtime system effects and mutability
are prohibited in global and message values, though operating system effects
(i.e. outside the Hemlock execution environment) are allowed. Runtime system
effects are lexically bound to a particular actor's local heap, and therefore
cannot be supported in the global heap. These restrictions are evaluated at
compile time, which means that the programming model is unaffected by type
erasure. The absence of dynamic validation overhead enables fast message
passing, as well as fully automated migration of compatible long-lived values to
the global heap.

# Parametrization

Non-parametric types have fixed effects and mutability, whereas parametric types
also have transitive effects and/or mutability that allow differing
parametrizations to be any combination of effectless/effectful and/or
immutable/mutable. For example, `'a array` is directly immutable, but it may be
transitively mutable depending on the particulars of the type supplied to the
`'a` parameter. Were we to attempt passing `'a array` in a message, the compiler
would be unable to prove that the message is compatible with the aforementioned
constraints. Therefore we must specify transitive immutability constraint for
the type, e.g. `'a array\&`. Similarly, finalization is only supported for
directly mutable values, e.g. `'a&`, because referential transparency of
immutable values makes finalization ill-defined.

Type syntax is rather involved in its most general form, but most of its
complexities only come into play with functorized module types. Following are
some examples from the Basis library.

```hemlock
'a list
'a array^
('k\&, 'v, 'cmp) map
('a\&, 'cmp) set

val halt: string >{hlt}-> 'a
val not_reached: unit >{hlt}-> 'a
val abort: string >{hlt}-> 'a

val finalize: ('a& >-> unit) -> 'a& >-> unit

type 'a elm =
  | Nil
  | Cons of 'a * ('a, >e) stream
also ('a, >e) stream = ('a elm, >e) Lazy.t
val force: ('a, >e) lazy_t >e-> 'a
```

Parametric type `'a` may have its own effect and mutability parameters, e.g.
`('aa, >a) 'a^`. For example, the set type could be `(>a 'a^\&, >cmp 'cmp^)
set`. The `'a` parameter is constrained to prohibit mutability, lest key
mutation corrupt the set.

Regarding effects versus mutability consider that `'a array&` is a mutable type,
but actual mutation is an effect.

```hemlock
val length: 'a array^_ -> uns
val set_inplace: uns -> 'a -> 'a array& >{mut}~> -> unit
```

The `length` function has no effect even though it can operate on a mutable
array, whereas the `set_inplace` function has a mutation effect on the array, as
indicated by `>{mut}~>`.

# Effects categories

Mutation-related effects are categorized as operating/runtime system and
read/write. Runtime system effects are only tracked for mutable data; indeed
reading immutable data is effectless, and writing immutable data is prohibited.
Runtime system effects impact mutable program execution state whereas operating
system effects impact state outside the program, e.g. file input/output (I/O).
Hemlock cannot in general accurately model operating system read-only effects
(and specific attempts would be fraught with peril), so all operating system
effects are modeled as combined read-write effects. Hemlock does model runtime
system read-only effects, but write effects imply read effects.

- `effect none = >{}`: Empty set
- `effect os`: Operating system read-write effect (mnemonic: Operating System)
- `effect ld`: Runtime system read effect (mnemonic: LoaD)
- `effect st`: Runtime system write effect (mnemonic: STore), used only via
  `>{mut}`
- `effect mut = >{ld,st}`: Runtime system read-write effect (mnemonic: MUTate),
  superset of `>{ld}` rather than disjoint so that both `\{ld}` and `\{mut}`
  effect constraints independently prohibit mutable data accesses.
- `effect conceal hlt`: Concealable may-halt effect (mnemonic: HaLT)
- `effect rt = >{mut,hlt}`: Runtime system effect (mnemonic: RunTime)
- `effect all = >{os,rt}`: Set of all effects

Effects are tracked at partial application granularity, though with the
exception of optional parameter defaults, it typically suffices to think in
terms of whole function applications. Furthermore, although types can in
principle have sophisticated parametric effects, the need rarely arises outside
of function signatures. Even function signatures rarely require the full power
of parametric effects.

```hemlock
val unzip_map: ('a >e-> 'c) -> ('b >f-> 'd) -> ('a * 'b) list
  >{>e,>f}-> 'c list * 'd list
```

Here `unzip_map` has the combined effects of two callback functions. Although
this generalizes to an arbitrary number of callback functions, the common cases
are zero and one. If there is only one parametric effect in a function
signature, the effect parameter name can be omitted, e.g.

```hemlock
val iter2: f:('a -> 'b >-> unit) -> 'a t^_ -> 'b t^_ >-> unit
```

Parametric mutability exists primarily to constrain function parameter types,
e.g. so that an input type dictates an output type. Consider this monomorphic
identity function:

```hemlock
val id: >e t^ -> >e t^
```

`id` subsumes several less general signatures, e.g.

```hemlock
val id_pure: t -> t
val id_mutable: t& -> t&
val id_effectful: >e t -> >e t
```

This basic concept enables more sophisticated parametric mutability within type
parameters. For example, suppose we want a record type to contain two `'a array`
fields of distinct parametric mutabilities.

```hemlock
type ('a, ^m, ^n) t =
    m: 'a array^m
    n: 'a array^n
val init: 'a array^m -> 'a array^n -> ('a, ^m, ^n) t
```

In more involved cases, parametric types require parameters which have no direct
bearing on the type's effects nor mutability. Such parameters are segregated
into a separate `[...]` parameter list, e.g.

```hemlock
type 'a outer^ = 'a t^outer
type ('a, ^m, 'b, ^n, >e) ['accum, 'c] t =
    m: 'a outer^m
    n: 'b outer^n
    f: uns -> 'accum -> 'a -> 'b >e-> 'accum * 'c
    index: uns
```

## `expose`/`conceal` and may-halt effects

The runtime requires most pre-defined effects to be fully transitive for
correctness reasons, so that, for example, it is impossible to hide a mutation
effect from the runtime. On the other hand, the may-halt effect can usually be
locally handled and hidden from callers without affecting correctness.
Furthermore, the may-halt effect would have a huge deleterious impact on APIs
were it allowed to transitively propagate without limit. Therefore the may-halt
effect is declared as concealable, so that it is concealed by default, and can
be explicitly exposed only where important to correctness.

```hemlock
effect conceal hlt
```

The outermost lexical scope conceals all concealable effects. The
`expose` and `conceal` keywords introduce lexical scopes which expose and
conceal specific concealable effects, respectively. In order for a function type
to divulge may-halt effects, all lexical scopes within the function which
contain the effectful code must expose may-halt effects. Following are several
examples of a division function which demonstrate how `expose`/`conceal` affect
may-halt effect visibility.

```hemlock
val halt_unless: bool >{hlt}-> 'a

# val div: uns -> uns -> uns
let div x y =                       # concealed | C
    halt_unless (y > 0)             # | >{hlt}  | C
    x / y                           # |         | C

# val div': uns -> uns >{hlt}-> uns
let div' x y = expose >{hlt}        # exposed  | E
    halt_unless (y > 0)             # | >{hlt} | E
    x / y                           # |        | E

# val div'': uns -> uns -> uns
let div'' x y = expose >{hlt}       # exposed     | E
    conceal >{hlt}                  # | concealed | C
        halt_unless (y > 0)         # | | >{hlt}  | C
    x / y                           # |           | E

# val div''': uns -> uns -> uns
let div''' x y = expose >{hlt}      # exposed      | E
    conceal >{hlt}                  # | concealed  | C
        expose >{hlt}               # | | exposed  | C
            halt_unless (y > 0)     # | | | >{hlt} | C
    x / y                           # |            | E
```

The limited need for may-halt effect tracking is a subtle topic. In many cases
the lack of may-halt effect tracking can be masked by associated data
dependencies and/or other effects, but there are some critical cases where code
breaks unless may-halt effects are tracked. For example, if we write a
`halt_unless` function as follows, calls to it can be optimized out.

```hemlock
val halt_pure: string -> 'a # Hypothetical effectless halt.
val continue: unit -> 'a

# val halt_unless: bool -> 'a
let halt_unless cnd =
    match cnd with
    | false -> halt_pure "Condition false"
    | true -> continue ()

# The result isn't used, so the call can be optimized out!
let _ = halt_unless false
```

This could be worked around by causing a mutation.

```hemlock
val halt_pure: string -> 'a # Hypothetical effectless halt.
val continue: unit -> 'a

# val halt_unless: bool >{mut}-> unit
let halt_unless cnd =
    match cnd with
    | false ->
        Printf.printf "Condition false"
        halt_pure "Condition false"
    | true -> continue ()

# div has a transitive mutation effect due to calling halt_unless.
# val div: uns -> uns >{mut}-> uns
let div a b =
    halt_unless (b <> 0)
    a / b

let x = div 4 2
let _ = div 1 0 # Division by 0 will halt.
```

Clearly `halt_unless` needs to have a may-halt effect in order to behave as
desired. In fact, this is also true of any otherwise effectless function which
may be called without regard for the result.

```hemlock
val halt_unless: cnd -> 'a

type t =
    field_a: bool
    field_b: uns

# Effectless; calls may be optimized out!
# val validate: t -> 'a
let validate t =
    halt_unless t.field_a
    halt_unless (t.field_b > 0)
```

In the following, `halt_unless` has a may-halt effect, because it exposes
transitive may-halt effects, namely those of the `halt` function.

```hemlock
# val halt: string >{hlt}-> 'a
# val continue: unit -> 'a

# val halt_unless: bool >{hlt}-> 'a
let halt_unless cnd = expose >{hlt}
    match cnd with
    | false -> halt "Condition false"
    | true -> continue ()

# No may-halt effect, even though div can halt!
# val div: uns -> uns -> uns
let div a b =
    halt_unless (b <> 0) # Always called if div is called.
    a / b

let x = div 4 2
let _ = div 1 0 # Would halt, but can be optimized away.
```

Note that `div` has no exposed may-halt effect, even though it can halt! That is
desirable in this case because there is no point in failing to divide by zero
unless the division actually needs to happen. But it would be possible to
`expose` halts within the function body and change the signature to
`(uns -> uns >{hlt}-> uns)`.

For most functions which produce non-unit values, concealing may-halt effects
is preferable, for multiple reasons:

- APIs are more stable if the addition/removal of an `assert` does not change
  the function signature.
- Otherwise-effectless functions which produce non-unit values usually need not
  be called if their results are unused. Exposing may-halt effects for such
  functions forces the compiler to preserve such calls even if they do nothing
  useful, such as calling `assert` even when the assertions are statically
  determined to be true (and therefore optimized out). Even functions with
  `_hlt` name suffixes rarely need to expose may-halt effects.

On the other hand, functions which produce the unit value and call a callback
function with transitive parametric effects should transitively expose the
callback's may-halt effects, in order to avoid an effects constraint on the
callback function.

```hemlock
# val iter2: f:('a -> 'b >-> unit) -> 'a array^_ -> 'b array^_ >-> unit
let iter2 ~f a0 a1 = expose >{hlt}
    let open Array in
    conceal >{hlt} (assert (length a0 = length a1))
    for i = 0 to pred (length a0) do
        f (get i a0) (get i a1)

let a = [|0; 1; 2|]
let b = [|3; 4; 5|]
# ~f's may-halt effect due to calling assert keeps the iter2 call from being
# optimized out.
iter2 ~f:(fun elm_a elm_b -> assert (elm_a + 3 = elm_b)) a b
# ... Dependencies on a and/or b which prevent optimizing them away.

# May-halt effects are prohibited in ~f because of may-halt concealment.
# val iter2': f:('a -> 'b >e\{hlt}-> unit) -> 'a array^_ -> 'b array^_
#   >e\{hlt}-> unit
let iter2' ~f a0 a1 =
    iter2 ~f a0 a1
```

## Combined application effects

Partial application of parameters to a function requires special consideration
if applied parameters have associated effects. Similarly, parametric effects
denoted by e.g. `>->` require special consideration when a supplied function has
parameter-specific effects.

Consider what happens when partial application of a parameter with associated
effects produces a closure. The resulting closure type must merge the
parameter's effects into the final application effects in order to preserve the
effect. Although this transformation reduces fidelity, it does not affect
correctness. The following example illustrates how mutation of `f`'s array
parameter preserves the mutation effect in the closure it produces.

```hemlock
# val g: uns array& >{mut}~> -> unit -> unit
let g arr () =
    Array.set_inplace 0 42 arr

# val f: uns array& >{mut}~> -> (unit >{mut}-> unit)
let f arr =
    g arr
```

In general, any time a partial application closes on a parameter with effects,
those effects are incorporated into the final application arrow for the
resulting closure. In the common case where all parameters are provided, the
relationship upon which this relies is invisible. The `f_precise` function as
defined below can be trivially wrapped and made compatible with the `f_general`
signature, but `f_precise` provides more precise information about what is being
mutated, which aids both programmer reasoning and compiler optimization.

```hemlock
val f_precise: uns -> uns array& >{mut}~> -> unit
val f_general: uns -> uns array& >{mut}-> unit
```

Although the compiler will infer the most precise function types possible,
Hemlock permits a module to expose a general function signature for a function
implementation with precise effect typing. Although such flexibility is of
limited utility for simple functions, it is critical to enabling succinct
parametric effect typing for callback functions. Consider the following use of
`iter2` as defined earlier.

```hemlock
val iter2: f:('a -> 'b >-> unit) -> 'a array^_ -> 'b array^_ >-> unit

# val a: uns array
let a = [|0; 1; 2|]
# val b: uns& array
let b = [|3&; 4&; 5&|]

# val f: uns -> uns& >{mut}~> -> unit
let f elm_a elm_b =
    elm_b := elm_a + elm_b

iter2 ~f a b
```

`f` is compatible with the `~f` parameter to `iter2`, even though `~f` only
parametrizes effects on the final application. While the following signature for
`iter2` would clearly account for per parameter effects, the above code works
because functions with precise effect typing are compatible specializations of
the more general form.

```hemlock
# Excessive parametric effect typing.
val iter2: f:('a >a~> -> 'b >b~> >f-> unit) -> 'a t^_ -> 'b t^_
  >{>a,>b,>f}-> unit
```

Precise effects typing of callback functions is useful for local optimization
even if the intermediary (e.g. `iter2`) is not specialized to take advantage of
the precision. And if the entire call chain is inlined, the precise effect
typing enables optimal machine code generation.

# Modules

Module types are special in that they can constrain which internal
implementation details are visible outside the module. Therefore module types
must explicitly reveal direct mutability, regardless of whether visible values
make the information redundant.

```hemlock
# X's type partially reveals why it is mutable (x and set are mutable).
let X
  : {|val set&: uns >{mut}-> unit|}&
  = module
    let x& := 0
    let set& := (fun u -> x := u)
# unit -> {|val set&: uns >{mut}-> unit|}&

# M's type doesn't reveal why it is mutable (m is mutable).
let M
  : {|val f: uns >{ld}-> uns|}&
  = module
    let m& := 42
    let f u = u * m
    X.mutate := (fun u -> m := u)
# unit >{mut}-> {|val f: uns >{ld} -> uns|}&
```

Note that the right-hand side (RHS) of the module assignment to `M` is actually
application of an effectful function. This is due to mutating `X.mutate` within
the module body, which occurs during module creation. The mutation is treated as
affecting the general environment rather than specifically `X`, because `X` is a
free variable, i.e. not a parameter to the module creation function. This
environment effect could be avoided as follows.

```hemlock
let make_M X
  : {|val f: uns >{ld}-> uns|}&
  = module
    let m& := 42
    let f u = u * m
    X.mutate := (fun u -> m := u)
# val make_M: {|val set&: uns >{mut}-> unit|}& >{mut}~>
#   -> {|val f: uns >{ld} -> uns|}&

let M = make_M X

# Equivalent to the above, but avoids creating the make_M lexical binding.
let M = (fun X
  : {|val f: uns >{ld}-> uns|}&
  -> module
    let m& := 42
    let f u = u * m
    X.mutate := (fun u -> m := u)
  ) X
# {|val set&: uns >{mut}-> unit|}& >{mut}~> -> {|val f: uns >{ld} -> uns|}&
```

If `X` were instead mutated inside `M.f`, then applying `M.f` would cause an
environment effect unless `X` were an explicit parameter to `M.f`, *regardless*
of whether the module creation function takes `X` as an explicit parameter. Put
simply, module creation functions behave typically with regard to effects, but
this fact is obscured by the `let M : {|...|} = module ...` syntax if the
programmer is unaware of its duality with the more general function application
syntax.
