# Runtime

The Hemlock runtime provides many of the services which are typically provided
by a time-sharing operating system. Hemlock's actors are isolated from each
other such that a misbehaving actor cannot typically dominate compute/memory
resources. Computation is round-robin time-sliced so that compute-intensive
actors cannot starve other actors. Automatic memory management (garbage
collection) enables strong memory access safety, and Configurable per actor
memory limits keep individual actors from unintentionally dominating memory
usage.

- [XXX Executors](executors.md) schedule actors, multiplex I/O, and drive
  incremental garbage collection for the global heap.
- [XXX Work stealing](work_stealing.md) can automatically distribute
  long-running pure computation when there are fewer runnable actors than there
  are executors.
- [XXX Messaging](messaging.md) between actors is the only mechanism for
  communication, though messages can refer to the global heap.
- [Automatic memory management](memory.md) which utilizes various garbage
  collection technologies is highly scalable and provides strong memory safety.
  Each actor has an isolated heap that requires negligible synchronization with
  the rest of the system. The global heap enables multi-actor collaboration on
  arbitrarily large data structures.
