(** [fmt_hr symbols prods ~alt ~width t formatter] formats a human-readable representation of [t].
    If [~alt=true], the output is broken across multiple lines with outermost indentation [~width]
    (elements are indented to [~width + 4]). *)

val length: t -> uns
(** [length t] returns the number of distinct kernel items in [t]. *)

val equal: t -> t -> bool
(** [equal t0 t1] returns true iff the contents of [t0] and [t1] are identical. *)

val empty: t
(** [empty] returns kernel attribs with no kernels. *)

val singleton: Lr1Item.t -> Attribs.t -> t
(** [singleton item attribs] returns singleton [item]->[attribs] conflict attributions. *)

(** [remerge1 remergeable_index_map t] creates kernel attribs with all remergeable LR(1) item set
    closure and state nub indexes translated according to [index_map], where keys are the original

    indexes translated according to [index_map], where keys are the original indexes, and values are
    the reindexed indexes. *)

val is_empty: t -> bool
(** [is_empty t] returns true if there are no kernel items in [t]. *)

val get: Lr1Item.t -> t -> Attribs.t option
(** [get item t] returns the conflict attributions of [item], or [None] if there are no conflict
    attributions on [item]. *)

val amend: Lr1Item.t -> f:(Attribs.t option -> Attribs.t option) -> t -> t
(** [amend item ~f t] returns an incremental derivative of [t] that is equivalent to [t] in all
    conflict attributions except possibly for [item], as determined by the result of [~f
    attribs_opt], where [attribs_opt = Some attribs] indicates [item] is associated with [attribs]
    in [t], and [attribs_opt = None] indicates [item] has no conflict attributions in [t]. The

val union: t -> t -> t
(** [union t0 t1] returns the union of per kernel conflict attributions in [t0] and [t1]. *)

val merge: t -> t -> bool * t
(** [merge t0 t1] computes the union of [t0] and [t1], and returns the result along with a boolean
    indicating whether the union is a strict superset of [t1]. *)

val inter: t -> t -> t
(** [inter t0 t1] returns the intersection of per kernel conflict attributions in [t0] and [t1]. *)

val diff: t -> t -> t
(** [diff t0 t1] returns the set of per kernel conflict contributions present in [t0] but not
    present in [t1]. *)

(** [attribs lr1itemset t] computes the attribs made by [lr1itemset] in the context of [t]. *)

(** [fold ~init ~f t] folds over the (kernel item, attribs) tuples in [t], using [init] as the

(** [fold ~init ~f t] folds over the (kernel item, attribs) tuples in [t], using [init] as the
    initial accumulator value. *)

val for_any: f:(Lr1Item.t * Attribs.t -> bool) -> t -> bool
(** [for_any ~f t] iterates over [t] and returns true if any invocation of [f] returns true, false
