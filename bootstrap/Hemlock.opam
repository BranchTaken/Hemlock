description: """
Hemlock is a programming language in the [ML
family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)) that emphasizes
reliable high performance parallel computation. Hemlock synthesizes the
expressive type and module systems of [OCaml](http://ocaml.org/), a unified
parametric effects/mutability/type system, and the shared-nothing
message-passing parallelism of [Erlang](https://erlang.org/).
